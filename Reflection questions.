README:i think i broke my original repo and I had to delete and create a new one, because of this I am missing the first 2 ish commits that had the inital files added as well as some starter code using the "!" in an html file. 

Since there are no specific reflection questions to answer I figured my reflection should include my use of old code. For starters, using the interactive registration form html and css files gave me a really good starting point and it was really easy to use that but I dont honestly know if thats allowed. Google was my best friend for this project as editing and deleting posts was originally done by using a post id (idea from the helper functions that I could add given in the instructions) that I had started to write a function for but that quickly devolved into using array indexs as I didnt really know what I was doing and it started to feel like I was biting off more than I could chew. Other than that, this sba went pretty smoothly probably because I reused a lot of old code but the javascript is all mine and I think works fairly well at least in my testing. If I were to improve anything, I would say editing the post in the "All Blog Posts" field instead of copying it to the input fields to be edited would probably be first on my list or at least giving some indication of which one is being fixed just for user clarity.
